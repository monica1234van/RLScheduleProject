COGS 182: Reinforcement Learning | Project 2

* This repository contains the following:
  * For Checkpoint 2: 
     * PDF of the environment dynamics
  * For Checkpoint 3:
     * 2 ipynbs with implementation of First-Visit Monte Carlo Control and TD(lambda) algorithms 
     * To run code: 
       * Executable version of Monte Carlo is hosted on Google CoLab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iNodo3RRL6jDROEr4mMEVNtxl2dEJkyb?usp=sharing
       * TD(lambda) Code is also on CoLab: 
     * 2 PDFs of the ipnyb runthrough, with outputs, results, and plots of MC and of TD
     * python versions of the 2 ipynbs
